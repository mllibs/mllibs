### :octicons-tasklist-16: **Available Tasks**

:material-tag-plus-outline: **User Recommendation System**

##### OVERVIEW: 

Creation of recommendations to user during the project

??? info

	=== "Problem Statement:"

		Currently there doesn't exist a mechanism that would allow a user to explore the functionality of the library content, nor are there mechanisms that would guide a user during the process doing a project. There is a need to develop an accurate and effective user recommendation system that that provide personal recommendations based on the user requests, as well as general trends/interactions that  

	=== "Purpose"

		The purpose of such functionality is to provide helpful suggestions, tips based on their preferences

:material-tag-plus-outline: **Module Function Label Classifier**

#### Overview

Creation of a classifier that would associate input text requests with module function labels 

=== "Problem Statement:"

	In order for module functionality to be activated, there needs to be an inbuilt library functionality that would link an input user request to module functionality

=== "Purpose"

	The purpose of such as classifier is to associated input text requests with module functions

	In order to implement such as a functionality, there is a need to create a

:material-tag-plus-outline: **Module Function Label Generator**

#### Overview

Creation of a generator that would associate input text requests with module function labels 

=== "Problem Statement:"

	One of the issues associated with user request interpretation is the association of text to module functionality. In order for module functionality to be activated, there needs to be an inbuilt library mechanism that would link an input user requests to module functionality/functions. One of the ways to achieve this is via the NLP text generation problem. The outcome of the inplementation of such functionality should be that the 

=== "Purpose"

	The purpose of such as generator is to associated input text requests with module functions

=== "description"

	In order to implement such as a functionality, there is a need to create a 

=== "Advantages"

	One of the benefits of using such functionality, especially over the classification approach is its model capability to interpret user requests

=== "Limitations"

	One of the limitations of such functionality is the speed at which the tokeniser & models are loaded. If they are to be loaded from HuggingFace for each user session, this would force the user to wait before starting their project
